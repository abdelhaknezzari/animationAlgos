## What is this
A basic typescript template with webpack setup to quickly start an HTML5 canvas development project.

## Setup
Just checkout or download the branch and run:

    npm install
    
And then you can run:

    npm start
    
This will start up a `webpack-dev-server` with auto reloading and watch on. Now any changes you make to file in the `src` directory will trigger a typescript compile and will refresh your app in the browser.
